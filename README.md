# Introduction to LibGDX
Learn the basics on how to write a game in LibGDX, which can then be exported to Android, iOS, HTML, and the Desktop!

## What is the project?
The sample game here is the same game we made in the [CreateJS workshop](https://github.com/luacm/createjs-intro). The point isn't to learn more game development math tricks, but instead to see how another engine works, as LibGDX is much more bare-bones than CreateJS. Therefore, there will not be any explanation of the math. If you would like to learn more about the math being done, you can look at the CreateJS workshop [source](https://github.com/luacm/createjs-intro/blob/master/js/game.js).  

All of the learning is done by looking at the code and reading the paragraph-long comments.

## How do I get started?

First, to download LibGDX, grab the latest release [here](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/download.html). Inside the folder you download, there's a jar file that helps you setup your game. To start it, navigate to the folder in the terminal and run ```java -jar gdx-setup-ui.jar```. The app will carry you through the rest of the setup process.
